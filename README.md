# Olympic Medal Distribution Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of Olympic medal distribution over the past 20 years, focusing on identifying key patterns and trends across participating countries.

This analysis reveals key insights, such as the dominance of the USA, China, and Russia in the Olympics, the rise of emerging countries like Japan and South Korea in specific sports, the significant improvement in gender equality in participation (especially in the Summer Games), the home advantage for host countries leading to more medals, and the moderate influence of population and GDP on medal counts, with sports infrastructure and athlete development being more critical factors.

This project highlighted the importance of data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization in uncovering global trends and understanding the factors driving Olympic success.
